Contributing Guidelines

All contributions to this repository are reviewed and committed by a human. Git commit history is the authoritative record of accountability.

AI tools may be used to assist with drafting, reviewing, or refactoring code and specifications. When AI assistance is used contributors shall document provenance using the x_provenance pattern described in the README.

Do not upgrade schema versions, standards, or external dependencies unless explicitly instructed by the project owner. Contract compatibility and governance constraints must be preserved.

If you are unsure about a change, open an issue or discuss before committing.
